For beginners like me to learn the concepts in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

To run this example:

1. `npm install browserify http-server -g`
2. [Download this repo](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example/archive/master.zip) or `git clone https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example.git`
3. From the repo folder run:
   `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in the browser

And also head over to http://redux.js.org/ for some great documentation.

There is also a [webpack](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example/tree/webpack) and an [ES5](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example/tree/es5) example.
